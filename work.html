<h1><u>ASSETT</u></h1>
<p>
I am currently working for the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Colorado at Boulder, on ASSETT'S team as a web developer.  I started working at ASSETT in 2013.  For my job at ASSETT, I redesign/maintain over 60 of CU Boulder's Arts and Sciences websites.  For the backend, we use Wordpress and Drupal.  This job has helped tone my skills at HTML, CSS, Javascript.

	<h1><u>Water World</u></h1>
<p>
	I worked at Water World, America's largest waterpark, from the summer of 2012 through 2013.  While there I managed a team of 5 employees which were in charge of the distribution of the food to the restaurant stands around the park.  I was also in charge of the orders for thousands of dollars worth of product.  This job provided me hands on experience leading and managing a team of employees to meet organizational goals.
