Ever since I was in a crib I have always gone to Lake Powell over the summer.  This has been a family tradition every year and I always love the time that I spend out there.  When I am there I love to fish.  Fishing at Lake Powell is amazing, because you can fish these things called boils.  Boils are where the fish are jumping out of the water and if you cast into them with a silver lure, you are bound to catch one!

	In 2012 I graduated from Legacy High School with a 3.8 GPA.  For my senior project I created a game that was similar Galaga except it had a twist, because there was a boss that was me!  This was programmed in LUA using Corona SDK.  After high school I was accepted into CU Boulder as an engineering student.  I came into Boulder as an open option engineer but that soon changed as I realized that programming was for me.  I am currently a Computer Science engineer with a minor in Economics.
