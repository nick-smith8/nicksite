<h2>About me</h2>

<p>
I am currently 20 years old, living in Colorado.  I played soccer my entire life and have always enjoyed being outdoors.  Some of my 
other hobbies include programming, playing games, and snowboarding.  I am currently a sophomore attending CU Boulder.  I am majoring in Computer 
Science engineering and getting a minor in Economics.  
</p>


<h2>Work Experience</h2>

<p>Currently I am working at ASSETT as a web developer.  I help maintain 60 of CU's Arts and Sciences websites and I also re-design for 
programs that want them.  From this job I am very efficient with using Drupal and WordPress.  Over the past summers I worked at Water World managing 
the distribution of the food in the park.  While there I managed a team of 5 employees which taught me a lot about leadership and how to 
manage a team to complete a task.  </p>
