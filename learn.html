	During my freshman year I was in an engineering projects class which partnered with the organization Imagine.  During this class my group of 3 and I got a client to work with.  Our client was a man who was partially blind and partially deaf while also having an intellectual disability.  The client asked us to make him a photo station that had pictures of the people that were in the house with him while having the audio of each of those peoples' names when they came up on the photo screen.  Also, this had to have two wireless buttons in which one controlled the movement of photos of people in the house with him and the other had to say the current time of day.  My group and I completed this with the use of Arduinos and a lot of other different technology.  The client is still currently using it which makes me feel really good about it because what I made is still improving someone else's life.</p>

	I am currently a sophomore that lives off campus and I commute to campus via the Buff bus.  After a couple of weeks riding it I decided that I was tired of wait and not knowing where the bus was and others were tired of this too.  This made me take action and start to create an app that tracks where the bus is.  If tracked, people wouldn't have to wait outside in the cold during the winter months and also it would make their lives more efficient since they wouldn't waste time standing at a stop.  I created the app for IOS and also a website for the app utilizing google's API.  I am currently working on the Android version and the app should be on the market and ready to download in late March.  This app has also sparked interest in me for making more apps to put on the market.
